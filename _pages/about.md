I am a postdoc at the Section for Cognitive Systems, DTU Compute. My research interests include concept-based explainability, exploring representations in hidden layers, human-machine alignment, and translating theory from cognitive science into the context of machine learning. I have a PhD from DTU Compute, under the supervision of Professor Lars Kai Hansen. The focus of my PhD was enhancing and explaining AI with a focus on biological data.
