Many research works focus on benchmark datasets and overlook the issues appearing when attempting to use the methods in real-world applications. The application used in this work is the detection of diseases and damages in grain kernels from images. This dataset is very different from standard benchmark datasets and poses an additional challenge of biological variation in the data. The goal is to improve disease detection and introduce explainability into the process. We explore how knowledge graphs can be used to improve image classification by using existing metadata and to create collections of data depicting a specific concept. We identify challenges one faces when applying post-hoc explainability methods on data with biological variation and propose a workflow for the choice of the most suitable method for any application. Moreover, we evaluate the robustness of these methods to naturally occurring small changes in the input images. Finally, we explore the notion of convexity in representations of neural networks and its implications for the performance of the fine-tuned models and alignment to human representations.
